# A Finite State Machine Player

### Method One: The Asset Library

Godot has a built in Asset Library that has many useful pre-built tools. From here we can download a very powerful **Finite State Machine Player** called *gd-YAFSM*. We can access the **Asset Library** by clicking the **Asset Library** view at the top of the **Godot** program:
