**Graphics** refers not to *how* something looks but how the image is produced from a technical standpoint. You may be familiar with some graphics concepts already. For example, you may have heard of image file formats such as .png, .gif, or .jpeg. We would use these files for **2D** graphics. There are also formats such as .glb, .stl, and .fbx. These are **3D** model formats. It is important to note that an image appearing "retro" or "pixelated" is an **Aesthetic** choice, not purely a **Graphical** choice. Your **Aesthetic** choices might influence the types of **Graphics** you use!

For **2D** images there are two categories for how the images are produced: *Raster* and *Vector* graphics. *Raster* images are made up of individual blocks of color called **pixels**. The amount of **pixels** contained in the image is the image's **resolution**, usually expressed in the width and height of the image in **pixels** ie. 1920x1080, 720x720, 38x38, etc. Low **resolution** images will look blurry when zoomed in on or scaled up, as the **pixels** are increasing in size.
