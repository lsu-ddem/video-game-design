**Mechanics** are the rules that govern how the player interacts with the video game or the game interacts with itself. This is a very broad topic that covers everything from how a player may navigate a menu to how the player moves around the game world. Below are examples of four games with different genres and aesthetics, but all of these examples show the same mechanic. Identify the mechanic and describe how it has been implemented differently for each example. (Here, implemented means how the mechanic works within the game. Think about what the core idea of the mechanic is and how each example does that idea differently.)
