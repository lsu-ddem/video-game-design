# Genre in Video Games


When **Genre** is discussed in literature courses we typically are referring to stories with similar tropes and settings. You may be familiar with **Genres** such as fantasy, dystopian, sci-fi, or horror. However, when discussing **Genre** in video games we are actually talking about groups of games with similar *gameplay characteristics*. What is a *gameplay characteristic* though?

*Gameplay characteristics* cover many different parts of a game including the player's objectives, how they move or control the game, and the game modes available among many other things. Let's talk about the *racing* genre to give us a better idea.


## Objectives

What do you think the *objective* of a player in a *race* would be? If you answered "come in first place" you'd be right! If you answered "complete the course as fast as possible" you would also be right! Often times a player will have many objectives in a game, games in the same **Genre** will share many of the same objectives, but may have their own unique ways to achieve an objective or entire objectives not shared by any other game within their **Genre**. 

For example, in *Mario Kart 8* players can use items that they find in boxes on the course to either aid themselves or impede their opponents. This is a unique way for the player to achieve the *objective* of "coming in first place"

In contrast, in a game such as *Forza Horizon 5* does not allow the player to collect items to affect the race. Instead, the game aims to provide a more *realistic* experience where the player's driving ability is the primary determiner of who achieves the "come in first place" *objective*.

Each of these games share the same **racing genre** *objective* of "come in first place" but the ways a player can achieve this goal are very different.

## Player interaction

How a player interacts with the game is also often similar between games in the same **Genre**. (We often call these interactions the **Mechanics** of the game which we'll discuss in a later section). Often players in the **racing genre** control a vehicle and are able to accelerate, brake, and turn. Let's look at a few different examples of how a game may allow their player to do this.

Below is a snowboarding racing game, *SSX Tricky*. In this game players race down a mountain on snowboards causing the player to automatically accelrate, have poor turning, can jump and do tricks, and slide on rails to traverse the course.

In contrast, in *Deck RX* is a turn based racing game. Players use cards to move their vehicle along the race track and impede opponents.

Compare these to the more conventional controls of *Forza Horizon 5* and *Mario Kart 8* where the player has full control of their character's acceleration, turning, and braking in real time. 


## Game Modes

If you have a keen eye you may have noticed that most the examples above have something else in common: placement. We can see in the first three examples a number on the screen that displays the player's current place in the race. These games all share a game mode where the player races against multiple opponents. Here's another example of a shared game mode: time trials. Here a player runs a track alone to complete the course in the fastest time.

Compare the games below, notice how in each race there are no visible opponents or placement markers.
