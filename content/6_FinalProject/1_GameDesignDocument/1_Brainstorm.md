Students will break into groups of no more than three to begin brainstorming potential projects for the semester. These initial concepts should be developed enough for someone outside the group to be able to understand what the game would be like, but do not need to delve into all of the specifics of the story and characters.

# Final Project Guidelines

The final project will be a substantial, multi-stage game exploring a mechanic created by the group. The game should take the player between 15-30 minutes to complete. Some examples of appropriate projects:

* A 2D Platformer with 5 levels, each with their own unique enemies, obstacles, and boss. Each level should take the player roughly 3-5 minutes to complete.

* A multi-player racing game with 5 different tracks. The vehicles can be customized to change their top speed, acceleration, and turning. There are also multiple power ups players can collect and use within the race.

* A colony simulation game with 3 different environments/factions. Players are tasked with collecting and managing resources, create buildings, and defend the colony for a set amount of time (roughly five minutes) in order to win the scenario. Each faction has unique buildings/playstyles

Some examples of innapropriate projects:

* A game where the player presses a button for 10 minutes to go to the next level. There are 3 stages

* An "arcade" style game where the goal is to get a highscore that only has one stage and one enemy.

* A "sandbox" style game with one stage and no objectives for the player to complete.



# Brainstorming

In your group, brainstorm 5 possible projects to work on over the semester. Make sure to include the following information:

* A short (150-200 words) description of the game
* Genre (and subgenre if applicable)
* Purpose of the game (What the player gets out of the game)
* Aesthetic
* Primary Mechanic (This mechanic should be what makes the game unique within the genre. For example, "jumping" would not qualify as the primary mechanic for a platformer due to it being a core mechanic to the genre. A primary mechanic may be that the player can collect 3 ingredients to create a special powerup related to the combination of ingredients.)
