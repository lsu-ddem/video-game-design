Once we've fleshed out our Game Design Document we can use it to inform our planning phase. We'll break our planning into three phases:

* Alpha
* Beta
* Polish

Due to the nature of the Game Design Document, it being a "living document", we may not have a good idea of a longterm plan at this stage. This is completely fine. We'll start by planning out our Alpha stage, focusing on the *core* of our game.
