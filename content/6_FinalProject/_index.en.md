This section provides resources and guidance on designing and developing a short game in the Godot Engine suitable for the final project. The section is broken up into four subsections:

* Final Project: The Game Design Document
* * Students design the concept for their game including: Characters, Story, Mechanics, and Structure. Large design choices are made here.
* Final Project: Alpha release
* * The "alpha" release of a game shows the core ideas of the game (primary mechanics, a test level, etc.) but may not be representative of the final product. During this section students may revise their Game Design Document, but once finished should no longer need to make edits.
* Final Project: Beta release 
* * The "beta" release of a game is representative of the final product but may still have missing content or bugs. At this point some things may not be complete but be nearly complete.
* Final Project: Polishing
* * In the "polishing" phase the game is complete and the goal is to make animations, mechanics, and code work and look as best as possible. There should be no major revisions at this point.


The goal of the project is to create something ambitious but completable within the scope of the semester. Students should finish the class having a functional version of their concept, even if that concept has gone through many revisions through the semester.
