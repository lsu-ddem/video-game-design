We will be using the terms "Alpha" and "Beta" loosely here. Typically, the "alpha" release of software is used for *internal* testing (meaning the developers are using it only) before being released to a wider audience for testing. For us, we'll use "alpha" to refer to the early stages of development, where the core features of the game are being made but may not work entirely correctly or may have serious bugs. We should use this as a time to solidify our concepts and focus the scope of our project. For the "alpha release" our project should:

* Include representative examples of the *core* features of our project. This could include the primary mechanics, some obstacles, simple menus, and other integral parts of the game.
* Have a place to test these features. This may be an early build of a level or just an open area. Our focus should be on getting things to work right now, not necessarily making them look nice.
* Have an example of the *core* gameplay concepts for our game. For example, if your game revolves around a player collecting objects, there should be an example scene that shows this feature working *mostly* properly.

What the "alpha release" should not be:

* The completed game. 
* Many uncompleted parts of the game. The alpha portion should be focused on developing the core of the game.
* Untestable. Building untestable components are fairly useless at this stage. Everything made at this point should be *testable* meaning you can see if it does or does not work.
* Only graphics/aesthetics. These concerns should be addressed further on in the process as this portion of the development cycle should be mostly concerned with coding and designing.
