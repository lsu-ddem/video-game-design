# Why Plan?
Think of planning for the alpha release as plotting out the foundation of our game. Every thing that we accomplish in this section of planning will be used with a high frequency within our game. This means our planning here is possibly the most important planning step. Here we will need to define the *core* components of our game. Think of these as the components that your player will interact with the most. This could include:

* Player
* Collectibles
* Enemies
* Obstacles
* Attack mechanics
* Health/Consumables
* etc.

Note, during this section of development we have not started making the actual levels. Don't worry, we'll get to that soon enough! The "alpha" stage will serve two purposes for us: providing a foundation and *focusing* our scope. This is the stage of development where we may remove or expand on design concepts. 

# Planning Document Template

For each team member and each given week, fill out the following information:

Team Member Name:

Primary Task: (This should be a major component of the game. Something the group will need to essentially make from scratch such as: "Make the health collectible, have the player collect it, and have it increase the player's health up to 100 but not more than 100". This is a good time to point to a specific page in your Design Document!)

Secondary Task: (This should be a minor component of the game such as: Add animations for the main character. Lay out a simple start menu. Add audio nodes to player scene. etc. These should be tasks that need to be completed but may not take a lot of time)


# What to do if a team member is absent?

We should always consider the *purpose* of the alpha portion of our development cycle: to test core components. This means if a team member is absent your team should evaluate what are the most *important* components and focus on those. This may require a present team member to change their task to the missing team member's task or for your team to re-order when you will do each task. 

### Consider the following scenario:

Team member A is absent. This week their primary task is to implement the jumping mechanic for your 2D platformer. This is a key feature, and if not completed many of your other components will be untestable! For this week, team member B is implementing a platform that falls after the player stands on it for a certain amount of time and team member C is implementing a collectible powerup that gives the player more health. 

Consider which of these three tasks may be more integral to your game, ie. which will the player interact with most often and which other mechanics interact with the task most often. Also consider which of these tasks may be *lease* integral. Order these tasks based on the *urgency* of their completion.

* Jumping
* Falling platform
* Health powerup

This may mean that your team pushes off one of these mechanics to the "beta" phase, or move it to a later week in the "alpha" phase. Regardless, it is important to communicate with your team if you are making changes to your plan. Make sure to not only agree verbally but to *update* your planning document if something has changed!
