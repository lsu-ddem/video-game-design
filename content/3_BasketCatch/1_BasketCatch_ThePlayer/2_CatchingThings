title: Catching Things - Area2D and Signals

Now that we can control our player and they can't be so easily pushed off the screen, lets turn our attention to catching our falling objects. Here we'll introduce a new node: the **Area2D**. We'll use an **Area2D** any time that we want to be able to monitor if an object is either *entering* or *exiting* a certain location, such as the the *center* of our player. **Area2D**s communicate this by using **Signals**. Whenever a **PhysicsBody** or another **Area2D** *enters* or *exits* an **Area2D** a **Signal** will be sent out. We can connect this **Signal** to any node that has a **Script** attached to it. This allows us to check when *collisions* are happening and run certain code when that happens.

Let's jump over to our *Player* scene. We'll start by adding an **Aread2D** to the root of our scene. We'll see that we have a caution symbol on our **Area2D**, this is because we need to define the *shape* of the **Area2D** using a **CollisionShape2D**. (This will look very similar to how we structure our **PhysicsBodies**) Once you've added your **CollisionShape2D**, select a **Rectangle2D** as its *Shape* in the **Inspector** and place it in the center of your player. Your scene tree and player should look similar to this:
