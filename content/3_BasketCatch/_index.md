## Unit 3

In this unit you will make a simple game where the goal is to catch fruit falling from the sky to score points. Through this we will learn about signals, UI, Globals, and the queue_free() function among other important topics. You will also practice making variables, referencing nodes, and creating scenes to make our game. We will also introduce the concept of game states here.
