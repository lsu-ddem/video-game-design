# The Godot Game Engine

## What is a game engine?

The software we will be using in this course is the Godot game engine. You may have heard of other game engines such as Unity or Unreal but there are many others you may not have heard of such as LÖVE, RAGE Engine, and RE Engine. We can think of a game engine as a toolbox to design, develop, and build a game. This includes tasks such as:

* Displaying images
* Managing memory
* Networking
* Player input
* Managing assets
* And so much more

Some game engine's toolboxes are filled with specialized tools to make very specific games. For example, LÖVE is a 2D only engine and does not have tools for handling 3D graphics. Some engines, like Godot, are multipurpose toolboxes that can make many different games (and even other software that aren't games). For this course we'll focus on the 2D side of Godot, though many of the concepts that we learn can be applied to making 3D games in Godot as well!


## How to Download Godot:

Go to [www.godotengine.org](www.godotengine.org/download)

1. Download the version for your operating system.

*If students are on a chromebook there is an Android version available in the Google Play Store.

2. The engine will download in a zipped folder, go ahead and unzip the folder by right-clicking and selecting "Extract All..."

3. If you have a flash drive, you can place the extracted Godot executable on it! Otherwise, move the extracted executable to a safe place on your computer.

4. With your Godot executable, make a folder that will hold all of your Godot projects. It should look something like this:

![Place your executable and a folder for your projects together](https://github.com/lsu-ddem/video-game-design/blob/master/content/media/EngineImages/My%20project%20folder.png?raw=true)

5. When starting a new project make sure the parent project folder is in your "My Godot Projects" folder.
